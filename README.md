## About This Applications

The AgroSine app, developed with the latest machine learning technology and ReactJS, is a crucial tool in the fight against farmer suicides. The agriculture sector, despite being the backbone of many economies, has been facing numerous challenges, including pest infestations that are one of the major causes of crop loss and income reduction for farmers. With the increasing number of farmers taking their own lives, it is imperative that we find innovative solutions to help improve their livelihoods.

The AgroSine app aims to tackle the issue of pest infestations in crops by providing farmers with the necessary information and advisory to protect their crops. The app uses cutting-edge technology such as image recognition and deep neural networks to detect the type of pest that is causing the infection in crops when an image of the infected plant is uploaded along with necessary details. The deep neural network model is trained on a large dataset of images and can be updated regularly with new images provided by users. This system contains comprehensive information on various plant and crop diseases and the corresponding treatments for different stages of the disease.

The user-friendly interface of the app allows different stakeholders in agriculture to access or update information based on their privileges. It is designed as a social community where farmers can post problems and receive solutions from agriculture experts or fellow farmers. The app is multi-lingual, making it accessible to farmers from different parts of the country, regardless of language barriers. The app also has a personal voice assistant to help illiterate farmers access information and services. Additionally, the proposed deep learning model is made available as a cloud service for users with limited device resources.

In conclusion, the AgroSine app is a step in the right direction towards improving the livelihoods of farmers and reducing the number of suicides in the agriculture sector. With its innovative approach, the app provides farmers with the necessary information and support to protect their crops, increase their income, and ultimately improve their lives. The app is a prime example of how technology can be used for the greater good and provide a brighter future for those in need.
