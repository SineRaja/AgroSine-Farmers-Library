    <string name="appledesc">\n Soil Preparation and Planting \n
Have the soil tested several months prior to planting. If liming is recommended, soil preparation should be done at this time so the lime will be incorporated into the soil at the time of planting. If phosphorous is recommended it should be incorporated along with lime before planting based on soil test results. Lime an area 10 feet by 10 feet where each tree will be planted. Plow or spade the area, followed by disking or raking to smooth the surface.\n
When fruit trees arrive from the nursery, open the bundles immediately. Soak the roots in water for 6 to 12 hours if they are not moist. The trees should then be planted if the soil is not too wet. \n
If the soil is not prepared where the trees are to be planted or the ground is too wet, heel the trees in by placing them in an open trench deep enough to cover all roots. The north side of a building is the best place for heeling-in because the trees will remain dormant longer. Place soil over the roots to the depth they will be planted.\n
Before planting, cut off all broken or mutilated parts of roots with a sharp knife or pruning shears. Keep root pruning to a minimum. Dig a hole large enough to receive the roots freely without cramping or bending from their natural position. Set the plant with the graft or bud union 2 inches above the soil line. Work soil in and around the roots. When the hole is half-filled, firm the soil lightly with your feet before completely filling the hole. When the hole is filled, pack the soil firmly. Do not leave a depression around the tree. Do not place fertilizer in the planting hole or fertilize immediately after planting.\n Diseases and Insects \n
A grower who produces the best-quality fruit controls diseases and insects. Several of these pests damage the tree and fruit.\n
Diseases common to apples are cedar apple rust, scab, black rot, bitter rot and fire blight. Damaging insects are codling moth, mites, scales, aphids and fruit worms. \n  </string>

    <string name="blackdesc">\n  Planting\n
The semi-trailing varieties should be planted 6 to 8 feet apart in the row, with rows 10 feet apart. The trailing types are less vigorous and should be planted about 4 feet apart, with rows 6 to 8 feet apart. Erect varieties are usually established by planting root cuttings. Plant these cuttings about 2 feet apart. Plant blackberries in early spring, about 4 to 6 weeks before the last frost. \n
When planting, make sure the crown is about 2 inches below the soil line. Carefully spread the roots. If there is a portion of an old cane attached as a “handle,” prune that back to 6 inches. When planting root cuttings, place the cuttings in a horizontal position and cover 4 to 6 inches deep in sandy soils or 3 to 4 inches deep in clay soils. \n  Problems \n
Insect problems on blackberries are minimal. Pests like aphids, Japanese beetles and spider mites can be controlled on an as-needed basis with general pesticides. Crown borers can be a serious pest. Chemical controls are not available. Diseases include rusts, fruit rot and “double blossom.” Control fruit rots with a sound fungicide program. Rosette, or “double blossom,” is a disease that causes the shoots to have a bushy, broom-shaped appearance on the tips. These shoots produce abnormal blossoms that will not mature to fruit but will produce spores that infect the new primocanes. Again, fungicides can be used in a preventive spray program. If severe infection occurs, summer mowing of all canes down to the ground will reduce infection of later emerging primocanes. Leaf and cane diseases are controlled by the use of copper, lime sulfur or Bordeaux. Apply all chemicals according to directions on the label.</string>

    <string name="cherimoyadesc">Problems \n Poorly formed fruit or reduced numbers of fruit can be due to several problems, but lack of pollination by bees is one of the most common causes. Blossom end rot is primarily due to inadequate calcium in the plant. This may be due to low soil pH, low calcium in the soil, and irregular uptake of water. Applying too much nitrogen fertilizer or planting too close can cause the plant to produce a lot of vine growth and very little fruit.\nInsect problems are usually critical only in the seedling or early growth stage. Cucumber beetles and aphids are the most noticeable problem insects.</string>

    <string name="watermelondesc">Problems \n
Poor pollination is the most common cause of mis-shapened fruit. Honeybees and several species of native bees pollinate watermelons. If adequate pollen is not deposited, fruit may be mis-shapened. To promote proper pollination, consider establishing a honeybee colony on site. \n To protect pollinators, avoid spraying insecticides while bees are foraging, especially between 8:00 am and 4:00 pm. \n Blossom end rot is caused by a calcium deficiency within the plant. However, the development of blossom end rot may not necessarily indicate a calcium deficiency in the soil. Calcium is highly mobile in the plants, and a consistent supply of calcium in the soil solution is necessary to prevent blossom end rot in developing fruit. If the water supply is interrupted, calcium is unable to move to the fruit and rot develops. To prevent blossom end rot, keep the soil uniformly moist, but not saturated. Do not allow the soil to dry out in between watering. Soil test before planting to ensure there is a sufficient level of calcium in the soil. See the “Watering” section for tips on proper watering.</string>

Seeds of brinjal are sown in nursery beds which are 3 meter long, 1 meter wide and15 cm high. Well rotten farm yard manure is then mixed in nursery bed. Nursery bed is then drenched with Captan solution two days before sowing to avoid the attack of damping off disease in brinjal nursery. Then seeds are sown in rows 5 cm apart and covered the nursery with compost or dry leaves. Light irrigation is done. The nursery beds should be covered with black polythene sheets or paddy straw till the seed germinates. Healthy seedlings having 3-4 leaves or 12-15 cm in height are ready for transplanting. Transplanting is done in evening and light irrigation is done after planting. \n LAND PREPARATION\n Before transplanting the soil should be well prepared by deep ploughing 4-5 times and levelled. When the field is well prepared and levelled, the beds of suitable size are made in the field before transplanting. \n SOWING\n Time of Sowing \n For first crop, prepare nursery in October and seedlings are ready for transplantation in November.\n Second crop, prepare nursery in November and transplantation in first fortnight of February.
Third crop, sow nursery in February-March and transplantation before end of April. \n Fourth crop, sow nursery in July and transplantation in August. \n  Spacing \n The spacing generally depends on the variety (size and spread and bearing period) soil fertility. Use row to row spacing of 60 cm and plant to plant spacing of 35-40 cm. \n Sowing Depth \n In nursery sow seeds at depth of 1 cm and then covered with soil.  \n Method of Sowing \n Transplantation of seedling in main field. </string>

    <string name="brinjaldesc"> WEED CONTROL \n Generally two - four weeding’s and hoeing are necessary for weed control, aeration and for the good growth of plants. Mulching with black polythene film reduces weed growth and maintains soil temperature. \n To control weeds efficiently, do pre-plant soil application of Fluchloralin@800-1000 ml/acre or Oxadiazon@400g/acre and pre-plant surface spraying of Alachlor@2 ltr/acre for better results. \n IRRIGATION\n Irrigate the field after every third or fourth day during the summer season and after 12 to 15 days during the winter season. Timely irrigation is very important for high yields of brinjal. Brinjal fields should be regularly irrigated to keep the soil moist during frosty days. Avoid water stagnation in field as brinjal cannot tolerate water logging. \n PLANT PROTECTION\n Fruit and Shoot Borer \n
Pest and their control \n Fruit and Shoot Borer: It is one of the major and serious insect pests of brinjal. A short pinkish caterpillar bores into the terminal shoot and eats internal tissue in initial stages, later it bores into the young fruit. The large holes can be seen on the infected fruits. The insect affected fruits become unfit for consumption. \n Scout field every week after transplanting for fruit and shoot borer infestation. Remove and destroyed infected fruits. Take spray of Triazophos@20ml/10Ltr water and Neem extract@50gm/Ltr, one month after transplanting. Repeat spray with interval of 10-15 days. When crop is in flowering stage take spray of Chlorantraniliprole 18.5%SC (Coragen)@5ml+Teepol@5ml in 12 Ltr of water, twice with 20 days interval. \n In initial stage of infestation, take spray of 5% Neem extract@50gm/Ltr. If infestation is seen in field take sprayed of 25% Cypermethrin@2.4 ml/10Ltr of water on affected crops. For high population spray Spinosad@1ml/Ltr of water. Avoid spraying of Triazophos or any other insecticide after fruit maturation and harvest. \n Aphids \n Aphids: \n The plants are also attacked by mite, aphids and mealy bug. They suck the sap from the leaves resulting in yellowing and drooping of leaves. \n If infestation of Aphid, white fly is observed in field to control take spray of Deltamethrin + Triazophos combination@ 10ml/10Ltr of water. To keep check on white fly spray with Acetamiprid@5gm/15Ltr of water. \n Thrips \n Thrips: \n  To check severity of thrips, keep blue sticky traps@6-8 per acre and to reduce the incidence take spray of Verticillium lecani@5gm/Ltr of water. If incidence of thrips is more, to control take spray of Fipronil@2ml/Ltr of water.\n
Mite \n Mite: \n If infestation of Mite is observed in field, to control take spray of Abamectin@1-2ml/Ltr or Fenazaquin@2ml/Ltr of water. \n
Leaf eating caterpillar \n
Leaf eating caterpillar: \n Some time Incidence of caterpillars is seen mostly at initial stage of crop. \n
To control spray with neem based pesticides. If those are not that effective and infestation become high then only take spray of chemicals pesticides like Emamectin benzoate@4gm or Lambda Cyhalothrin@2ml/1Ltr of water. \n Root Knot Nematodes \n Disease and their control \n
Root Knot Nematodes: It is common in brinjal crop. These are more harmful at initial stage of seedlings. They cause root galls. Due to infestation of root knot nematodes, plant get stunted, give yellow appearance and thus affect yield.\n Avoid monocropping and follow crop rotation. Incorporate Carbofuran or Phorate@5-8kg/acre in the soil.\nDamping Off: \n Moist and poorly drain soil causes damping off disease. It is soil borne disease. Water soaking and shrivelling of stem occurs. Seedlings killed before emergence. If it appears in nursery the entire lot of seedling may get destroyed. It is a serious disease of brinjal. \n Before sowing do seed treatment with Thiram@3gm per Kg of seeds. Do soil solarisation of nursery soil. If damping off is observed in nursery. Drained out water and drenched soil of nursery with Copper Oxychloride@3gm/Ltr of water. \n Phomopsis Blight and Fruit Rot \n
Phomopsis Blight and Fruit Rot:  \n Dark brown color spots appear on leaves. The fruit show watery lesion and becomes black in appearance. \n
Before sowing do seed treatment with Thiram@3gm per kg of seeds. Use blight disease resistant variety for cultivation. If infestation observed in field take spray of Zineb@2gm/Ltr of water or Mancozeb@2.5gm per litre of water. \n  Little Leaf: \n The affected leaves become thinner. The petal turn green leaf like. Infected plant does not bear fruit. The disease is transmitted by leaf hopper.\n
Use disease resistant variety. In nursery use 10% Foret (20 gm, for 3 X 1 m broad bed). At time of sowing apply Phorate in between two rows of seeds. If infection observed, at initial stage, removed disease affected plants. Spray the crop with Dimethoate or Oxydemiton Methyl@1ml per litre of water. Little leaf is spread mainly through Aphid infestation, to keep check on Aphid Population spray with Thiamethoxam 25%WG@5gm/15Ltr of water. \n Mosaic:\n Light and green patches observed on leaves. Small bubbles or Blisters are form on leaves and leaf size remains small. \n
Select healthy and disease free seeds for cultivation. Uproot and destroyed infected plant away from field. Recommendations given for aphids may be adopted. (Take spray of Acephate 75SP@1gm/Ltr or Methyl demeton 25EC@2ml/Ltr of water or Dimethoate@2ml/Ltr of water.</string>

    <string name="chilicat">GENERAL INFORMATION \n It is known as the most valuable crop of India. It is used as a principle ingredient of various curries and chutneys, also used in vegetables, spices, condiments, sauces and pickles. Pungency in chillies is due to the active constituent "Capsaicin", an alkaloid. The native home of chilli is considered to be Mexico with secondary origin of Guatemala. Chilli was introduced in India by the Portuguese in Goa in the middle of 17th century and since then it had rapidly spread throughout the country. Capsaicin has many medicinal properties, especially as an anti-cancerous agent and instant pain reliever. It also prevents heart diseases by dilating blood vessels. Major chilli growing countries are India, China, Pakistan, Indonesia, Korea, Turkey and Sri Lanka in Asia; Nigeria, Ghana, Tunisia and Egypt in Africa; Mexico, United States of America in North and Central America; Yugoslavia, Spain, Romania, Bulgaria, Italy and Hungary in Europe and Argentina, Peru and Brazil in South America. India is the world leader in chilli production followed by China and Pakistan. Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, UP and Rajasthan are the main chilly growing states. \n SOIL \n Chilli is grown in many types of soils-sandy to heavy clay. A well-drained, fairly light fertile loam with a fair moisture holding capacity is ideal. The light soils produce better quality fruits than heavy soils. Chilli crop prefers a soil reaction ranging from pH 6–7.\n LAND PREPARATION \n Carry out ploughing for 2-3 times and clod crushing after each ploughing. Add compost or Farm Yard Manure @150-200 qtl/acre and mix well in the soil 15-20 days before sowing. Form ridges and furrows at spacing of 60cm. Apply 0.8 kg/acre of Azospirillum and 0.8 kg/acre of Phosphobacteria by mixing with 20 kg of FYM.\n
IMP: Do not cultivate Tomato and Chilly crop in same field or in nearby field, as pest and diseases are similar. Also spread anthracnose and bacterial disease. When it is intercropped with onion and coriander, it gives additional income also helps in controlling weed population. For nematodes control, take onion, garlic or merry gold as intercrop.</string>

    <string name="chilidesc"> WEED CONTROL \n Apply Pendimethalin @1ltr/acre or Fluchloralin @800ml/acre as pre-emergence herbicide followed by hand weeding once 30 days after planting. Carryout first weeding operation after 25 days of planting. Depending upon intensity, repeat weeding and keep field free of weeds.\n IRRIGATION \n It cant withstand heavy moisture so apply irrigation only when needed. Heavy irrigation causes lanky vegetative growth and flower drop. Number of irrigation and interval of irrigation depend on soil and climatic condition. If plant show dropping at 4 pm, it is indication of plant needed irrigation. Flowering and fruit development are most critical stages of water requirement. Stagnation of water should not be allowed in nursery and field as it causes fungal infection. \n PLANT PROTECTION\n Fruit Borer \n Pest and their control \n Fruit borer: Caterpillar eat leaves of crop afterward they enter into fruit and caused heavy loss in yield management. Collect and destroyed damaged fruits and grown up caterpillars. Set up pheromone traps for Helicoverpa armigera or Spodoptera litura at 5 Nos./acre. \n
To control pod borers apply poison bait balls made up of bran-5 kg, Carbaryl-500 gm, Jaggery-500 gm and sufficient amount of water. If infestation of fruit borers is observed. spray Chlorpyrifos + Cypermethrin (Nurel-D/Amla) @30 ml+Teepol@0.5 ml in 12 Ltr of water with power sprayer. Spray with Emamectin benzoate 5% SG @4 gm/10 Ltr of water or Flubendiamide 20 WDG@6 gm/10 litre of water. \n Mite\n Mite: These are widely distributed pest observed throughout the world. It attacks on several crops like potato, chilli, beans, cotton, tobacco, curcurbit, castor, jute, coffee, lemon, citrus, blackgram, cowpea, pepper, tomato, sweet potato, mango, papaya, brinjal, guava. Nymphs and adults feed exclusively on the lower surface of the leaves. Infected leaves give cup shape appearance. Heavy infestation results in defoliation, bud shedding and drying of leaves.\n
If Infestation of yellow mite and thrips is observed in field, spray of Chlorfenapyr@1.5ml/Ltr, Abamectin@1.5ml/Ltr are found effective. Mite is a serious pest and it may cause yield loss up to 80%. For effective control spray Spiromesifen 22.9SC@200ml/acre/180Ltr of water.\n Aphid\n
Aphid: They attack mostly in winter month and later stage of crop. They suck sap from the leaf. They excrete honey like substance and developed sooty mold i.e blackish colour fungus on the calyx and pods thus deteriorate quality of product. Aphids also work as important insect vectors for chilli mosaic. Mosaic disease transmitted by aphids cause 20-30 percent loss in yield.\n To control, take spray of Acephate 75SP@5gm/Ltr or Methyl demeton 25EC@2ml/Ltr of water. Soil application of granular insecticides viz Carbofuran, Phorate@4-8kg/acre on 15 and 60 days after transplanting were also effective. \n White Fly \n White fly: The nymphs and adults of White fly suck the cell sap from the leaves and weaken the plants. They secrete honey dew on which black sooty mould develops on leaves. They also transmit leaf curl diseases. To check infestation use yellow sticky traps coated with grease and sticky oils. \n In case of severe infestation to control take spray of Acetamiprid 20SP (@4gm/10Ltr of water or Triazophos@2.5ml/litre or Profenophos@2ml/litre of water. Repeat the spray after 15 days. \n Powdery Mildew\n Disease and their control
Powdery Mildew: Patchy, White powdery growth appears on lower side of leaves. It parasitizes the plant using it as a food source. It commonly occurs on older leaves just before or at fruit set. But it can develop at any stage of crop development. In severe infestation it causes defoliation. \n
Avoid water lodging in field. Keep field clean. To control spray with Hexaconazole(Contaf, Sitara) along with sticker @1 ml/Ltr of water. In case of sudden rain, chances of powdery mildew are more. Mild infestation take spray of water soluble Sulphur @ 20 gm/10 Ltr of water 2-3 times with interval of 10 days.\n Phytophthora blight: It is caused by the fungus Phytophthora capsici. It is soil borne and commonly observed on soil with low drainage capacity and areas where proper cultural practices have not been maintained. Also cloudy weather is favourable for spread of this disease.\n Avoid crop rotation with brinjal, tomato, cucumber, pumpkin for atleast three years. Spray with Copper oxychloride@250gm/150Ltr of water.

Use of Immidachloprid-17.8%SL @7 ml in 10 litres of water is done to cure disease. \n Pest and their control:\n Fruit fly: It is a serious pest found in longmelon. Females fly lay eggs below epidermis of young fruits. Later on maggots feed on pulp afterward fruits starts rotting and get drop.\n Treatment: Foliar application of Neem oil @3.0% is given to cure the crop from fruit fly pest. \n Aphid and Thrips: They suck the sap from the leaves resulting in yellowing and drooping of leaves. Thrips results in curling of leaves, leaves become cup shaped or curved upward.  \n Treatment: If infestation is observed in field, to control spray the crop with Thiamethoxam@5 gram/15 Litre of water. \n Flea beetle: They are small shiny black beetles which feed on young plants.\n
Treatment: To control flea beetle spray with Malathion 50 EC@1 ml or Dimethoate 30 EC@1 ml per one ltr of water.\n HARVESTING \n Depending upon variety and season first picking is done after 60-80 days of sowing. Harvesting is done after 7 days of fruit setting. Picking should be done at the interval of 2-3 days.\n </string>

    <string name="sweeetpotatcat">GENERAL INFORMATION \n The botanical name of Sweet potato is Ipomoea batatas. This crop is mainly grown because of its sweet taste and starchy roots. The tubers are rich source of beta-carotene and are used as anti-oxidants. It is an herbaceous perennial vine having lobed or heart shaped leaves. Its tubers are edible, smooth skin, tapered and long. It has wide color range of tuber skin i.e. purple, brown, white and purple which contains wide range of flesh i.e. yellow, orange, white and purple. In India about 2 lakh of land is under cultivation of sweet potatoes. In Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa are the major growing states in India. \n SOIL \n It is grown in variety of soil types ranging from sandy to loamy soil, but it gives best result when grown under sandy loam soil having high fertility and good drainage system. Avoid cultivation of sweet potato in very light sandy and heavy clayey soil as it is not good for tuber development. It requires pH ranging from 5.8-6.7 is best for sweet potato cultivation.\n LAND PREPARATION \n For sweet potato plantation, the land should be well prepared. To bring the soil to the fine tilth, before sowing land must be ploughed 3-4 times followed by planking’s. The field should be weed-free.\n </string>

    <string name="sweetpotatdesc">WEED CONTROL \n Apply Metribuzine 70WP@200gm per acre or Alachlor@2Ltr per acre before sprouts emergence. On 5-10% sprout emergence and ridge are infested with weeds then only apply Paraquat@500-750ml per acre. \n IRRIGATION\n After planting, irrigation is given once in 2 days for period of 10 days and thereafter irrigation is given once in 7-10 days. Irrigation must be stopped before 3 weeks of harvesting. But before 2 days of harvesting one irrigation is necessary. \n PLANT PROTECTION\n Black Scurf\n Disease and their control: \n Black scurf: Black speck observed on tubers. Affected plant show drying up. In infected tubers, at time of sprouting, black, brown color appear on eyes.\n For planting use diseased free tubers. Before sowing, seed treatment with Mercury is essential. Avoid mono-cropping and follow crop rotation. If land kept fallow for two years then severity of disease is reduced. \n Early Blight\n Early blight: Necrotic spots observed on lower leaves. The fungus due which infestation occurred lies in soil. It rapidly spread in high moisture and low temperature.\n Avoid mono-cropping of crop and follow crop rotation. If infestation is observed, take spray of Mancozeb@30gm or Copper oxychloride@30gm/10Ltr water at 45 days 2-3 times at 10 days interval.\n Common Scab\n Common scab: It survives in field as well as in storage. Disease is spread rapidly in low moisture condition. Light brown to dark brown lesion are appeared on infected tubers.\n Use only well rotten cow dung for application in field. Use diseased free seeds for planting. Avoid deep planting of tubers. Follow crop rotation and avoid mono cropping in same field. Before sowing, treat seeds with Emisan 6@0.25% (2.5gm/Ltr of water) for five minutes.\n Sweet potato weevils\n Pest and their control: \n Sweet potato weevils: They damage the plant by feeding themselves on the epidermis of vines and leaves.\n
Treatment: To control weevils spray of 200 ml Rogor @150 ltr water per acre. </string>

    <string name="tomatocat">GENERAL INFORMATION\n Tomato is originated in Peru of South America. It is important commercial vegetable crop of India. It is the second most important crop of world after potato. Fruits are eaten raw or in cooked form. It is rich source of vitamin A, C, potassium and minerals. It is used in soup, juice and ketch up, powder. The major tomato producing states are Bihar, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. In Punjab state, Amritsar, Ropar, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur are tomato growing districts. \n SOIL\n It can be grown in varied type of soil ranging from sandy loam to clay, black soil and red soil having proper drainage. It gives best result when grown under well drained sandy soil with high organic content. For good growth pH of soil should be 7-8.5. It can tolerate moderate acidic and saline soil. Avoid cultivation in high acidic soils. For early crops, light soil is beneficial where for heavy yields clay loam and silt-loam soils are useful. \n LAND PREPARATION\n For tomato plantation, it required well pulverise and levelled soil. To bring soil to fine tilth, plough land for 4-5times, then planking is done to make soil level. At time of last ploughing add well decomposed cow dung and Carbofuron@5kg or Neem cake@8kg per acre should be applied. Transplantation of tomato is done on raised bed. For that prepared raised bed of 80-90cm width. To destroy harmful soil borne pathogen, pest and organism, soil solarization is carried out. It can be done by using transparent plastic film as mulch. This sheet absorb radiation and thus increases soil temperature and kill pathogen.</string>

    <string name="tomatodesc"> SOWING \n Time of sowing \n For northern state, tomato cultivation for spring season is done in late November and transplanted in second fortnight of January. For autumn crop, sowing is done in July - August and transplanted in August - September. In hilly areas sowing is done in March- April and transplantation is done in April -May.\n Spacing\n Depending upon variety use and its growth habit, use spacing of 60x30cm or 75x60cm or 75x75cm. In Punjab, for dwarf variety use spacing of 75cm x 30cm and for rainy season use spacing of 120-150 x 30cm.\n Sowing Depth\n In nursery sow seeds at depth of 4cm and then covered with soil.  \n Method of sowing\n Transplanting of seedling in main field.\n SEED\n Seed Rate \n Use seed rate of 100gm for preparing seedling for sowing in one acre land. \n Seed Treatment \n To protect crop from soil borne disease and pest, before sowing do seed treatment with Thiram@3gm or Carbendazim @ 3gm of seeds. After chemical treatment, treat seed with Trichoderma@5gm/kg of seeds.  keep it in shade. And use it for sowing. \n WEED CONTROL\n Do frequent weeding, hoeing and earthing up and keep field weed free till 45 days. If weed left uncontrolled then it will reduce crop yield upto 70-90%. Two to three days of after transplantation take spray of Fluchloralin (Basalin) @800ml/200Ltr water as pre-emergence weedicide. If weed intensity is high, take post emergence spray of Sencor@300g/acre. Mulching is also an effective way to reduce soil temperature along with weed control.\n IRRIGATION\n
In winter, apply irrigation with interval of 6 to 7days and in summer month, apply with interval of 10-15days depending upon soil moisture. Period of drought follow by heavy watering leads to cracking of fruits. Flowering stage is critical for irrigation, water stress during this stage can leads to flower drop and adversely affecting fruiting and productivity. According to various researches, it is found that, half inch irrigation at every fortnight causes maximum penetration of roots and thus gives high yield.\n PLANT PROTECTION \n Leaf Miner\n Pest and their control: \n Leaf Miner: Maggots of leaf miner feed on leaf and make serpentine mines into leaf. It affects the photosynthesis and fruit formation. \n
At initial stage, take spray of Neem Seed Kernel Extract@5%, 50gm/Ltr of water. To control leaf miner, spray with Dimethoate 30EC@250ml or Spinosad@80ml in 200Ltr of water or Triazophos@200ml/200Ltr of water.\n White Fly \n White fly: The nymphs and adults of white fly suck the cell sap from the leaves and weaken the plants. They secrete honey dew on which black sooty mould develops on leaves. They also transmit leaf curl diseases.\n After sowing of seeds in nursery, cover bed with 400mesh nylon net or thin white cloth. It helps to protect seedlings from pest-disease attack. To check infestation use yellow sticky traps coated with grease and sticky oils. To control spread of whiteflies, uproot and destroy affected plants. In case of severe infestation, take spray of Acetamiprid 20SP@80gm/200Ltr of water or Triazophos@250ml/200litre or Profenophos@200ml/200litre of water. Repeat the spray after 15 days.\n  Thrips\n Thrips: Commonly observed pest. Mostly observed in dry weather. They suck sap from the foliage and results in curling of leaves, leaves become cup shaped or curved upward. Also causes flower drop.\n
To check severity of thrips incidence, keep blue sticky traps @6-8 per acre. Also to reduce the incidence of this disease, spray Verticillium lecani@5gm/Ltr water. If incidence of thrips is more, then take spray of Imidacloprid 17.8SL @60ml or Fipronil@200ml/200Ltr of water or Acephate 75% WP@600 gm/200Ltr or Spinosad@80ml/acre in 200Ltr water.\n Gram Pod Borer \n Gram Pod borer or Heliothis armigera: It is a major pest of tomato. Crop loss due to Helicoverpa is about 22-37% if not controlled at proper stage. It feeds on leaves also on flower and fruits. On fruits they make circular holes and feed on flesh.\n In case of initial infestation, handpicked grown up larvae. At early stage use HNPV or Neem extract@50gm/Litre of water. To control fruit borer, put 16 pheromone traps/acre at equal distance after 20 days of transplanting. Change lure in every 20 days interval. Destroy infested parts. If pest population is high, spray Spinosad@80ml+sticker@400ml/200Ltr of water. To control shoot and fruit borer, spray Rynaxypyr(Coragen)@60ml/200Ltr water. \n Mite \n Mite: Mite is a serious pest and it may cause yield loss up to 80%. These are widely distributed pest observed throughout the world. It attacks on several crops like potato, chilli, beans, cotton, tobacco, curcurbit, castor, jute, coffee, lemon, citrus, blackgram, cowpea, pepper, tomato, sweet potato, mango, papaya, brinjal, guava. Nymphs and adults feed exclusively on the lower surface of the leaves. Infected leaves give cup shape appearance. Heavy infestation results in defoliation bud shedding and drying of leaves.\n If Infestation of yellow mite and thrips is observed in field, spray of Chlorfenapyr@15ml/10Ltr, Abamectin@15ml/10Ltr or Fenazaquin @100ml/100Ltr are found effective. For effective control spray Spiromesifen 22.9SC(Oberon)@200ml/acre/180Ltr of water. \n Fruit Rot\n Disease and their control: \n Fruit Rot: Major disease of tomato and observed due to changing weather. Water soaked lesions are appeared on fruits. Afterwards they turn into black or brown color and causing rotting of fruits.\n Before sowing, do seed treatment with Tricoderma@5-10gm or Carbendazim@2gm or Thiram@3 gm/Kg of seeds. If infection observed in field collect and destroy  infected fruit and leaves which lies on ground. Fruit rot and anthracnose attacked mostly observed in cloudy weather, to control take spray of Mancozeb@400gm or Copper Oxychloride@300gm or Chlorothalonil@250gm/200Ltr water. Repeat spray with 15 days interval.\n Antracnose \n Anthracnose: Warm temperatures, high moisture are ideal condition for spread of this disease. It is characterized by black spots that are formed on infected parts. Spots are usually circular, water-soaked and sunken with black margins. The fruits with many spots drop off prematurely resulting in heavy loss of yield.\n If Infestation of Anthracnose is observed. To control this disease, spraying of  Propiconazole or Hexaconazole@200ml/200Ltr of water should be done.\n Early Blight \n Early Blight: Common and major disease of tomato. Initially small, brown isolated spots are observed on leaf. Later spots are seen on stem and also on fruits. Fully developed spots become irregular, dark brown color with concentric ring inside spots. In severe condition, defoliation occurred.\n If infestation of early blight is observed, take spray of Mancozeb@400gm or Tabuconazol@200ml/200Ltr. Repeat spray 10-15 days after first spray. In cloudy weather, chances of incidence of early and late blight increases. As a preventive measure, spray with Chlorothalonil@250gm/100Ltr of water. Also sudden rain pattern aggravate blight and other diseases take spray of Copper based fungicides@300gm/Ltr+Streptocycline@6gm/200Ltr water to control blight disease. \n Wilt and Damping Off \n Wilt and Damping off: Moist and poorly drain soil causes damping off disease. It is soil borne disease. Water soaking and shriveling of stem occurs. Seedlings killed before emergence. If it appears in nursery the entire lot of seedling may get destroyed.\n To prevent root rot, drench soil with 1% Urea@100gm/10Ltr and Copper oxychloride @250gm/200Ltr water. To control wilt, drench nearby soil with Copper oxychloride@250gm or Carbendazim@400gm/200Ltr of water. Increased temperature and humidity due to watering facilitate fungal growth at roots, to overcome it, apply Trichoderma 2 kg/acre along with cow dung near roots of plants. To control soil born disease, drench soil with Carbendazim@1gm/Ltr or Bordo mix@10gm/ltr, 1 month after that apply 2 kg Trichoderma /acre, mixed with 100kg cow dung. \n Powdery Mildew \n Powdery Mildew: Patchy, white powdery growth appears on lower side of leaves. It parasitizes the plant using it as a food source. It commonly occurs on older leaves just before or at fruit set. But it can develop at any stage of crop development. In severe infestation it causes defoliation. \n Avoid water lodging in field. Keep field clean. To control this disease, spraying with Hexaconazole along with sticker @1ml/Ltr of water should be done. In case of sudden rain, chances of powdery mildew is more. Mild infestation takes spray of water soluble sulphur@ 20gm/10Ltr of water 2-3 times with interval of 10 days. \n HARVESTING\n
Plant starts yielding by 70days after transplantation. Harvesting is done depending upon purpose like for fresh market, long distance transport etc. Mature green tomatoes, 1/4th fruits portion gives pink color are harvested for long distance markets. Almost all fruits turn into pink or red color but having firm flesh are harvested for local markets. For processing and seed extraction purpose, fully ripe fruits with soft flesh are used.</string>

    <string name="turnipacat">GENERAL INFORMATION\n It is hardy cool weather crop belongs to family of Brassicaceae. It is grown for its roots as well as for green leaves. Turnip root is rich source of Vitamin C where as its leaves are rich source of Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin K, foliate and Calcium. It is grown in temperate, tropical as well as sub-tropical region of India. Commonly grown turnip is of white color. Bihar, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are major turnip growing states in India. \n SOIL\n
It can be grown on variety of soil but turnip give best result when grown on loamy soils rich in organic matter. Avoid heavy or compact soils also very light soils as it produce rough, malformed roots. Ideal pH of soil for good growth is 5.5 to 6.8. \n  LAND PREPARATION \n
Plough land thoroughly and make land weed and clods free. Add well decomposed cow dung of 60-80 qtl/acre and mix well in soils at the time of land preparation. Avoid use of undecomposed or free cowdung as it will leads to forking of fleshy roots. </string>


    <string name="turnipdesc">WEED CONTROL \n 10-15 days after germination, carry out thinning operation. Take interculture operation like weeding and hoeing to keep check on weed growth also to provide soil aeration. Take one weeding operation, two to three weeks after sowing. After weeding, carryout earthing operation.\n  IRRIGATION \n After sowing, apply first irrigation, it will help in good germination. Depending upon soil type and climate, apply remaining irrigations at the interval of 6-7 days in summer and 10-12 days interval in winter month. Overall turnip required five to six irrigations. Avoid excessive irrigation as it will leads ugly shape of roots and numerous hair growth.\n PLANT PROTECTION\n Crown rot \n Disease and their control:\n Crown rot: As a preventive measure, before sowing treat seed with Thiram@3 gm per kg of seeds. 7th and 15th day after sowing, drenched soil around seedlings with Captan@200 gm in 100 ltrs water.\n HARVESTING\n Depending upon variety uproot turnip roots after attaining marketable size i.e. when they are 5-10 cm in diameter. Generally roots are reached to marketable size in 45-60 days i.e. depending upon variety after sowing. Delay in harvesting will leads to tough and fibrous root formation. Carry out harvesting in evening time. After harvesting, roots along with green tops are washed with water. They are filled into the basket and then sent to market. Under cool and moist condition, roots can be stored for 2-3 days where as they can store for 8-15 week at 0-5 °C temperature with 90-95% relative humidity. \n
SEED PRODUCTION \n For seed purpose, sow seeds of turnip in mid-September and then transplant seedling in first week of December. Use spacing of 45 cm x15 cm. Apply N@30 kg (in form of Urea@65 kg) and P@8 kg (in form of SSP@50 kg) per acre. At time of sowing apply whole amount of Phosphorus and half amount of Nitrogen. Apply remaining amount of Nitrogen, 30 days after sowing. Carry out harvesting when 70% pods changes its color to light yellow. </string>


    <string name="rosecat">If you are planning for start to flower farming then Rose Farming Business is the profitable business for farmers. Here in this article, you will see the step by step information for Rose Farming Business in India. Rose is the king of all flowers and it is a very pretty flower which is grown in all around the world. Rose flower is praise for its beautiful look and aroma.\n

The scientific name of the rose is “Rosa” and it belongs from the “Rosaceae” family. Rose flowers and Rose oil are very demanded in the local market as well as in the global market. It places the first position in the international market.\n

Generally, rose plants are six ft high from the land. The Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and West Bengal are the most rose farming project state in India. The successful commercial rose farming process mostly depends on the varieties of rose flower. In latest technology, there are many rose planting methods are available but the rose cultivation in greenhouse method is very famous and convenient for rose plants.\n
 </string>

    <string name="rosedec">Normally one-year-old budded plants having at least 3 canes on rockstocks like Rosa indica var. odorata or R.canina or R.manetti are most ideal for greenhouse cultivation.\n

Cultivars :’Golden Gates’, ’Grand Galla’, ’First Red’, ’Kiss’, ’Konfetti’, ’Mercedez’, ’Ravel’, ’Noblesse’, ’Vivaldi’ and ’Starlite’.\n

Planting :Optimal planting time is October-December. The planting density should be between 7-13 plants/m2 (50-60 thousand bushes/ha area). Planting should be done preferably in 2-row system.\n

Temperature requirement : The greenhouse temperature is generally maintained from 200C or 210C on cloudy days and 240C –280C on sunny days. However, the temperature range of 15-270C is optimum.\n

Fertiliser dose : Liquid fertilizers containing 200 ppm nitrogen and 150 ppm potassium plus iron and magnesium as needed, can be applied with good results in a wide range of soil conditions. Binding of unproductive shoots leads to more number of basal sprouts.\n

Harvesting and yield :
Red and pink cultivars are harvested when first 2 petals are beginning to unfold and calyx is reflexed below the horizontal lane.\n

Yellow cultivars are harvested slightly earlier and white cultivars slightly later than red and pink types.\n

After cutting the stem ends are dipped in 200-500 ppm citric acid or aluminium sulphate and placed in cold storage at 10C till grading. Stem ends are recut, bunched in 20’s and placed in preservative solution with sucrose up to 2%.\n
Flower yield of 250-350 stems/m2 is considered to be ideal.\n

Flower yield can be increased by spraying BAP 50-100 ppm before flowering flush. Burning of saw-dust during winter months in the morning hours (7-10 AM) increases flower yield and quality significantly. </string>

    <string name="carnationcat"> Perpetual carnations (Dianthus caryophyllyus)\n

Cultivars : Among standard type cultivars, Master, Tanga, Sonsara, Laurella, Solar, Dakar, Raggio di Sole, Cabaret and Isac are most promising, while Bagatel, Cherrybag, Fantasia, Picaro, Ondelia, Sintonia and Macarena are spray types.
</string>

    <string name="carnationdec">Temperature requirement : temperature is maintained at 20-25 0C\n

Planting :\n
Plant density of 20-30 plants/m2 is optimal (1.5 –2.0 lakh/ha).Can be planted round the year under greenhouse environment.\n

Fertilizer dose : A nutritional dose of 40 g N, 20 g P2O5 and 10g K2O is ideal. Liquid feeding of carnation plants with nutrient levels of 190 ppm N and 156 ppm K, and 1 ppm B with each irrigation water results in high grade carnation. Overhead sprinkling is quite effective and economical than soil surface irrigation. At bud appearance stage, over-head sprinklers should be replaced with soil surface system.\n

Practices followed : Pinching, disbudding and deshooting are important practices followed in the standard carnations. Pinching should generally be done by leaving 5-6 nodes on the plant. In case of standard type, terminal buds are retained and all auxiliary buds are removed and vice-versa in spray type. Plants need support [2-3 layers of nylon mesh (10x10 cm size)] when 45 cm in height. After pinching, spraying BAP (100 ppm) increases production.\n

Harvesting and yield : Standard carnations are harvested at paint brush stage and sprays when 2-3 upper flowers in the inflorescence are open and remainders showing colour. The flowers after harvest should be pulsed with 10% sugar + 4 mM STS for 10-12 hr and at 2-4 0C. The flowers are kept in sugar 2% + 0.5 mM STS for prolonging vase-life.\n

Yearly production of 300-400 flower/m2 is ideal and economical. </string>
    <string name="liliescat"> Lilies, especially Asiatic and Oriental types are most fascinating, in international floriculture trade.</string>
    <string name="liliesdec"> Cultivars : \n
Connecticut King, Gran Paradiso, Elite, Pollyanna, Prato and Solemio among Asiatics, while Star Gazer, Marco Polo and Casablanca in case of Orientals are highly promising. Easter lily (Lilium longiflorium) var. Osant (white) is also grown under polyhouses.\n

Forcing : \n
Forcing lily flower for normal durations, the bulbs require cold treatment at 2-40C for 6 weeks in case of Asiatic hybrids and 8 weeks for the Oriental ones. It is possible to use "frozen-in" bulbs which are kept at 10C after pre-cooling treatment for off-season flowering. A night temperature of 16 0C with a day temperature below 21 0C inside the greenhouse is recommended for forcing.\n

Planting : \n
The best time of planting hybrid lilies under north Indian climate is from mid-September to mid-December. Planting density depends on cultivar, bulb size and time of the year, with a range of 25-60 bulbs/m2.\n

Light requirement :\n
Light is very important factor for lily culture. High light intensity in summer reduces the stem length and therefore 50% shade nets are recommended to cover the crop. Low light intensity in winter leads to flower abortion and abscission. Supplementary lighting during winter increases yield, stem sturdiness and quality of flowers.\n

Plants require liquid feeding or use of controlled released fertilizers. Supporting plants with nylon mesh is advisable.\n

Harvesting and yield : \n
Asiatic hybrids take 8-10 weeks, while Orientals 14-16 weeks from planting to harvesting, but `frozen –in’ (Eskimo) takes less time The blooms are cut when the lower most flower bud is fully coloured but not open. Cut lilies could efficiently be started both dry (sealed in plastic bags) or wet (1/10 portion in 25 ppm silver nitrate) at 10C cold storage temperature up to 4-6 weeks provided they are pulsed with 0.2 mM STS + 10% sucrose for 24 hr.</string>
    <string name="chrysanthemumcat"> Chrysanthemum is a very popular flower crop of commercial importance. Chrysanthemums are grown in 2 ways for cut flowers, depending upon market demand.</string>
    <string name="chrysanthemumdec">Disbudded inflorescence : \n
All flower buds except terminal ones are removed to allow one inflorescence/stem to develop. If the bloom is an incurved or reflexed type and in between 10 and 15 cm in diameter, is usually referred as standard.\n

Spray inflorescence :\n
 The entire cyme is allowed to bloom but very often the central inflorescence (oldest) is removed at the time colour begins to show in the ray flowers. These groups are usually known as pompon or spray chrysanthemums.\n

Light and temperature requirement : \n
Chrysanthemum is primarily a typical short day plant and normally cannot form flower buds when day length exceeds 14 1/2 hr. Light and temperature are important environmental factors influencing growth and development. Chrysanthemums are broadly classified into 3 groups on the basis of their response to temperature. Thermozero varieties flower at any temperature ranging 10-270C but most consistently at a constant 160C night temperature. Thermopositive varieties require higher temperature (270C) for bud initiation and lower temperature inhibit completely. Thermonegative varieties flower at any temperature between 10 and 270C, but flowering is delayed at higher temperature.\n

Cultivars : \n
Selection of cultivars is very important while doing greenhouse cultivation. Spiders are preferred in the Netherlands and Germany while single spray types in Denmark, Sweden and Finland, UK and Japan prefer decorative types of mums.\n

Most promising cultivars in the international trade are Snow Ball, Snow Don White, Mountaineer, Sonar Bangla, Bright Golden Anne, and Chandrama among large flowering types while Ajay, Birbal Sahani, Lehmans, Nanako, and Sonali Tara in case of small flowering types as sprays are most common.\n

Planting :\n
 July-August is ideal time of planting chrysanthemum in north India. However, if controlled photroperiod facilities are available planting can be done round the year.\n

Planting density varieties from 32 to 56 plants/m2.\n

Practices : \n Pinching and disbudding are most important cultural practices for the production of quality blooms. Growth regulator spraying of B-9 (Alar) or Cycocel 2-3 blooms of good quality.\n

Harvesting : \n Standard types are generally harvested when outer ray florPlanting : Planting medium should be adequately porous and well-drained. The optimum planting, density recommended for large flowering cultivars is 8-10 plants/m2. Two –row or 4-row planting systems are generally used. Planting can be done round-the-year but preferably during September-October. The plants should be left undisturbed for 2 years for flower production (no separation of clumps). Treating plants with GA3 (100 ppm) results in early flowering having long stems.\n

Temperature requirement : \n The temperature during day time should be 16-200C and 120C during nights.\n

Harvesting and yield : \n The harvesting stage is critical as the flowers should not be cut before the outer row of flowers show pollen, or the flowers will wilt and close at night. Optimum storage temperature (wet) for gerbera is 40C. The flowers could be stored efficiently up to 4 weeks.
